# Webscraping Marketing Project

This repository contains code and documentation for collecting data from web pages for marketing analysis. The project is in its early stages and currently includes a basic Python script demonstrating how to scrape a webpage and save the results.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` – Source code for web scraping scripts
- `data/` – Folder for storing scraped data
- `docs/` – Project documentation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (You may create `requirements.txt` to list your dependencies, e.g., `requests` and `beautifulsoup4`.)

2. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python src/webscraper.py
   ```
   The script fetches the title of `https://example.com`. If it cannot
   reach the site (for instance, when there is no internet access), it
   prints a fallback message instead.

## Next Steps

- Expand the scraping logic to target the web pages you are interested in.
- Add tests and continuous integration.
- Document your scraping targets and data model in the `docs/` directory.
